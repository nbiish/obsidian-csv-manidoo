# Expertly Craft Enterprise-Grade Code

Run `eza --all --tree --level=2` for most up to date repo context before proceeding...

## Structure codebase according to the **DNA Design** pattern -> `repo-root/dna/`

- **Atoms** (`dna/atoms/`) - Core utilities, data types, state management
- **Molecules** (`dna/molecules/`) - Composite components, deployment scripts
- **Proteins** (`dna/proteins/`) - High-level flows and orchestration

## Maintain **Documentation** in `knowledge-base/`

- knowledge-base/mini-PRD.md
- knowledge-base/mini-TODO.md
- knowledge-base/*.mini-DOCS.md
- knowledge-base/mini-memories.md
